--Getting Started--

1. Refer to our example Layout

    We don't want to overwrite your default layout - in fact, it requires us to jump through some hoops and we're afraid we might annoy you. 
    If you could kindly change your Views/_Layout.cshtml file to look like this:

    @{
        Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.Code52.cshtml";
    }

    that'd be awesome.

2. Create your Language resource file

    Add a new item > Resources File. (If resources file isn't visable try changing the selection on the left hand side to the root (such as Visual C#)
    I usually create a resource file specifically for language resources

    Ensure the strings is the current section selection.

    If your resource file is in a seperate project you may wish to change the access modifier to public so you can access it from other projects.


--Customizing--

If you want to update your master page (say if you've got some sweet markup), you'll need to have a look at the Views/Home/Index.cshtml and see 
which has a section like this:

@section featured {
	<!-- bitching markup here -->
}

Because of that, we've got our own _Layout.Code52.cshtml file. Feel free to modify that to suit.

--Cleanup--

Lastly, to switch it back to how you had it, just change your Views/_Layout.cshtml file back to:

@{
    Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml";
}
